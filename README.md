# tufte.js

Tufte style plots for the browser. Inspired
by [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/). These are not (and will not
be) complete as far as comparison to "Tufte in R" is considered.

The key idea is to create an ultra minimal library for simple clutter-free
visualizations. At places, I have relied on the possibility of interactiveness
to deviate from the *default* Tufte style which helps in removing more *ink*. In
case some of the ink is missing, its because either they are in plan or I have
actuall missed them (because of my narrow use case) or they are better suited to
a visualization apt for *small data*, like a table.
