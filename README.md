Tufte style plots for the browser. Inspired
by [Tufte in R](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/). The plots here are not
exhaustive and more plots will be added as I feel need for them.

The idea is to create an ultra minimal library for simple visualizations. At
places, I have relied on the possibility of interactiveness to deviate from the
*usual* Tufte style which helps in removing more *ink*. In case some of the
*required* data ink is missing, its because either they are in plan or I have
actually missed them or they are better suited to a visualization apt for *small
data*, like a table.

> This project is not associated with Edward Tufte and is purely an opinionated
> take on his visual style.
